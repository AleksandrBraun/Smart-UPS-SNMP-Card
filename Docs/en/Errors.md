The Status, Errors and Warnings tab allows you to evaluate the current status of the UPS.
Such as:
- UPS in battery life calibration mode
- SmartTrim - output voltage limitation mode at increased input voltage without switching to battery operation
- SmartBoost - the mode of increasing the output voltage with a reduced input voltage without switching to battery operation
- UPS output overload
- work from a line or accumulators
- critical battery level
- insufficient battery capacity (it's time to change the battery)
- being in Bypass mode (through power transmission through the UPS without an uninterruptible power supply) and the reason for switching to this mode
- readiness of the UPS to turn on the output at the user's command or upon the return of voltage in the network, in case of its loss
- other faults and limits exceeded (*see UPS service manual*)
