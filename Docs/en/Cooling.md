1. The minimum level of PWM (voltage) on the fan, at which it begins to rotate
    - It is necessary to test the minimum for the start of rotation when the lower temperature threshold in the UPS is exceeded. Depends on the type of fan, its degree of wear, etc.
   - The test button runs the fan at the specified PWM level for 10 seconds. If the fan does not start, you need to raise the PWM level above
2. Temperature at which to start UPS forced cooling
3. Temperature at which the fan will rotate at maximum speed
